/**
  * A team's challenge display image, offered to that team's members as the
  * picture for their challenges. Images are moderated: a member uploads one as
  * a request and it only becomes usable once a superuser approves it.
  *
  * A team holds one image at a time. A new request sits alongside the image
  * the team is currently using until it is reviewed, and on approval takes its
  * place - inheriting the challenges the old image was on, so cards keep a
  * picture across the swap. Rejected images stay behind as history, which is
  * why a team can still have several rows here.
  *
  * The raw bytes are deliberately not part of this case class — they are only
  * read when actually serving the image, so listings never pull them out of
  * the database.
