/**
  * A report against a challenge's design -- "this challenge is poorly designed
  * and is causing people to make incorrect edits" -- rather than a bug or a
  * feature request. Any authenticated user can file one, and anyone can read
  * what has been reported about a challenge, since filing also posts a public
  * challenge comment naming the reporter and quoting the report. The triage
  * queue is superusers only: it carries the email address the reporter may have
  * volunteered for follow-up, and the notes admins leave on a decision.
  *
  * Reports are resolved, never deleted: an admin marks one actioned (say, after
  * archiving the challenge) or dismissed, so the history of what was reported
  * and what was done about it stays intact.
