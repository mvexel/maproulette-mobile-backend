# --- MapRoulette Scheme

# --- !Ups

-- Upstream maproulette-backend 129.sql (grant role check), renumbered for the fork: the fork
-- already used 129-132 on deployed databases. See docs/fork-changes.md.
-- Make sure grant roles make sense for their types:
--   - teams can use owner/admin/manager/member
--   - projects and challenges can use admin/write/read
-- Superuser grants are special, have no role, and always target project 0.
