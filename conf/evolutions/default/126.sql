-- Challenge reports are complaints about a challenge's design -- "this
-- challenge is poorly designed and is causing incorrect edits" -- as opposed
-- to bugs or feature requests. They used to be filed as issues in a public
-- GitHub repo, which meant shipping a write-scoped GitHub token to the browser
-- and publishing the reporter's identity. They live here instead so triage
-- happens inside MapRoulette and the reporter's contact details stay private.
